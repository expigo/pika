## 🔐 Security Considerations

- ✅ **HTTPS Required:** Service workers only work over HTTPS (enforced in production)
- ✅ **Scope Isolation:** SW scoped to `/` (entire app)
- ✅ **Content Security:** No eval() or inline scripts in SW
- ✅ **Auto-Updates:** `skipWaiting: true` ensures users get security patches
- ✅ **Error Reporting:** All SW errors reported to Sentry

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Custom build pipeline** - Bypassing plugins was the right call
2. **Automated verification** - Caught issues before manual testing
3. **Comprehensive docs** - Future engineers will understand the system
4. **Serwist over next-pwa** - Modern, maintained, flexible

### What Could Be Improved (Sprint 2)

1. **Precache optimization** - Could use workbox-build for smarter chunking
2. **Update notifications** - Show banner when new SW available
3. **Background sync** - Android-only, requires API setup
4. **Push notifications** - Requires backend changes

### Technical Debt (Intentional)

1. **No runtime precache updates** - Requires full refresh on deploy (acceptable trade-off)
2. **No custom worker logic** - Using Serwist defaults (can extend later)
3. **No analytics on cache hits** - Could add in Sprint 2
4. **Memory-Only History** - `useTrackHistory` relies on SWR memory cache. Refreshing while offline results in an empty history list. Needs IndexedDB persistence.
5. **Vote Queue Parity** - Deployment fallback page claims votes are queued, but `useTempoVote` currently drops votes if the socket is closed. Needs `idb-keyval` integration similar to `useLikeQueue`.
