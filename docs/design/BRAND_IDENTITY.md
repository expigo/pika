# Pika! Brand Identity & Visual Language

This document codifies the visual and psychological principles of the Pika! brand to ensure consistency across all surfaces.

## 0. The Ideology: The Bidirectional Conversation

Pika! is built on the profound magic of the **West Coast Swing Connection.** In our world, roles are not hierarchical; they are conversational.

- **The Booth (The Lead)**: Initiates the energy, sets the frame, and offers the rhythm.
- **The Floor (The Follower)**: Receives the energy, transforms it through personal identity, and sends the response back through the connection.

Pika! is the **Neural Fiber** that makes this interaction possible in the digital age. We don't "broadcast" music; we **facilitate a handshake.** Every pulse, like, and signal is a "weight change" in the connection. If the conversation is one-sided, the dance dies. Pika! ensures the room breathes together.

## 1. Color System (The Audience Channels)

Pika! uses semantic color-coding to define the three distinct user groups in our ecosystem. This mapping must be adhered to in all components, iconography, and ambient effects.

| Audience | Color | Tailwind Class | Semantic Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **THE BOOTH** (DJs) | Purple | `purple-500` | Authority, Logic, The Source |
| **THE FLOOR** (Dancers) | Pink | `pink-500` | Energy, Passion, The Response |
| **THE GRID** (Organizers)| Emerald | `emerald-500` | Infrastructure, Stability, The Foundation |

## 2. Spatial Archetypes

Pika! moves beyond "roles" into "spaces." This naming convention establishes a universal narrative for all social dance genres.

- **THE BOOTH**: The source of music and control. Visuals focus on telemetry, signal flow, and real-time command.
- **THE FLOOR**: The center of the experience. Visuals focus on identity, personal history, and vibration.
- **THE GRID**: The global infrastructure. Visuals focus on coordination, scheduling, and massive-scale data.

### Application Rules:
- **Primary Glows**: Use the audience's color for atmospheric gradients and card glows.
- **Interactive States**: Buttons and links for a specific persona should hover/activate in their respective color.
- **Iconography**: Icons associated with personae should use their color as an accent or tint.

## 2. Typography (The "Sport/Pro" Identity)

Our typography is built on the **Geist** family, utilizing contrast to balance human connection with technical precision.

### The "Definitive" Scale
- **Section Headers**: `font-bold` + `italic` + `uppercase`. These are the high-performance anchors of the page.
- **The "Selective Period"**: Use terminal punctuation (a period `.`) ONLY at the end of major section headers (e.g., THE DJ'S SIXTH SENSE.). Avoid using periods on small labels, card headers, or technical steps to maintain a clean, "dashboard" aesthetic.
- **Scan-Reading**: Use selective `font-semibold` on key functional phrases within body descriptions to guide the user's eye.

## 3. Motion & Interaction

- **Weight**: Hover states should feel "physical" (use `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` for a snappy spring effect).
- **Atmosphere**: Use high-index atmospheric masks (`z-50` gradients) to submerge technical mockups into the background, avoiding "cardboard cutout" syndrome.

## 5. Narrative Motion (The Connection)

The landing page is a single, continuous flow representing the **"Handshake"** between roles.

- **The Relationship Pulse**: A vertical or horizontal energy thread (using audience-specific colors) must connect sections to show the "transfer of data."
- **Evolutionary Bleed**: When moving from one Phase to another, use predictive glows (ambient spills) to prepare the eye for the next role's color before the content arrives.
- **Technical Vitality**: Use micro-animations (scanner lines, blinking sensor dots, subtle flickers) to show that the system is **LIVE**, never static.
