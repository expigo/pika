# Pika! Organizer Guide

**"Enhance the Event Experience without adding complexity."**

## What is Pika!?
Pika! is a "bionic suit" for your DJs. It enables real-time communication between the DJ booth and the dance floor. 

**For your event, it means:**
1.  **Happier Dancers:** They know what song is playing (no more Shazam on the floor).
2.  **Engaged Crowd:** Dancers can "like" tracks and save them for later.
3.  **Modern Brand:** Shows your event is tech-forward and cares about the dancer experience.

## Technical Requirements (The "Will it break?" Section)

### Option A: Cloud Mode (Easiest)
*   **Requirement:** The DJ Laptop needs internet access (Venue WiFi or Mobile Hotspot).
*   **Bandwidth:** Extremely low (< 10KB per song). It will NOT slow down your venue WiFi.
*   **Dancers:** Use their own 4G/5G data. No venue WiFi required for them.

### Option B: The "Bunker" Mode (Robust / Offline)
*   **Scenario:** Your venue has zero cell service and no internet.
*   **Requirement:** A simple WiFi router (provided by DJ or Tech team).
*   **How it works:**
    1.  DJ plugs in a router (no internet cable needed).
    2.  Dancers connect to the "Pika-Event" WiFi.
    3.  Everything runs locally. Zero lag. 100% reliable.

## FAQ for Organizers

**Q: Does it cost money?**
A: Currently in **Beta**, Pika! is free for qualified WCS events.

**Q: Will it distract the dancers?**
A: Pika! is designed to be **"Glanceable"**. Dancers verify the song, tap like, and put the phone away. We explicitly avoid "Social Media" features that keep eyes glued to screens.

**Q: Can I put my Event Logo on it?**
A: Yes! The "Live View" can display your event banner at the top, ensuring every time a dancer checks a song, they see your brand.

**Q: How do I announce it?**
A: We provide a **"Print-Ready QR Code Flyer"** (PDF) you can tape to the DJ booth or check-in desk.
